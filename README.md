Additional Tips
Portfolio Preparation:

Prepare a portfolio of your past projects. Include examples of challenges faced and how you resolved them.
Highlight instances where you introduced new processes or tools that benefited the team.
Leadership Examples:

Think of scenarios where you effectively mentored someone, resolved conflicts, or drove innovation.
Hands-On Skills:

Brush up on coding challenges and algorithms. Platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank are good resources.
Prepare a small project demonstrating your understanding of React, CI/CD, and Agile workflows.
Documentation and Communication:

Be ready to discuss how you document processes, code, and best practices.
Practice articulating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
Questions for Them:

What tools and technologies does the chapter currently use?
What are the biggest challenges facing the frontend chapter today?
How does the organization encourage innovation and professional growth?
By preparing for these questions and scenarios, you’ll be well-equipped to showcase your technical expertise, leadership capabilities, and strategic thinking during the interview. Good luck!
